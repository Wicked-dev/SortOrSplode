        In this minigame, the player must use the mouse to place the bombs that
        appear in their correct sections. Red bombs go in the red section, and
        black bombs in the black section As the minigame goes on, more and more
        Bombs appear and more frequently. You can also lose by taking too long
        to place a bomb in the correct section.
